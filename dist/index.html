        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p1> Hi, my name is Jane Collazo and I'm a digital artist and content creator. I have a passion for creating beautiful and engaging digital art and content, and I'm always looking for new and exciting ways to express myself and share my work with others.
           In addition to my work as an artist and creator, I'm also an aspiring web developer. I'm currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm excited to use these skills to create my own web applications and websites.
           I believe that my background in digital art and content creation, combined with my growing expertise in web development, makes me a unique and valuable asset to any team or project. I'm always looking for opportunities to collaborate and create, and I'm excited to see where my skills and passion will take me next.</p1>
